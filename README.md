# Alyssa Day
## Overview

Recent Data Science graduate with a passion for predictive analytics and urban research. Proficient in Python, SQL, machine learning, and data visualization, I build projects that address meaningful societal challenges like crime prevention, housing policy, and environmental health.

## About Me

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Data Science from UNC Charlotte in Spring 2025, with minors in Artificial Intelligence and International Studies. Skilled in Python, Java, SQL, and Power BI, I am eager to apply advanced analytical techniques to solve complex, real-world problems at the intersection of technology and global issues.

## Recent Projects
- Global Energy Consumption Trends (in progress): Analyzed international energy data with SQL and Power BI to visualize transitions from fossil fuels to renewable energy.

- Air Quality Index Prediction: Developed machine learning models to forecast daily AQI using geographic and pollutant features.

- Crime and Housing Vacancy Analysis: Investigated how crime rates predict residential vacancies using predictive modeling and social theories.

- Fake News Classification: Built and compared machine learning classifiers to detect misinformation in news articles.

## Goals

- **Expand Expertise:** Continuously improve skills in data science, cloud computing, and AI tools to address evolving challenges.

- **Bridge Disciplines:** Integrate data science, artificial intelligence, and international studies for innovative, interdisciplinary solutions.

- **Global Impact:** Leverage data-driven insights to support diplomacy, sustainability, and equitable development worldwide.
